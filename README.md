# FlashcardGenerator
Generates Anki flashcard decks from scraped data using Python's BeautifulSoup library.\
The .py files (e.g. dog_breeds.py) create CSVs containing questions/answers that can be imported in the Anki desktop app.\
<br />

### Examples include:
dog_breeds.py:
> Question = Picture of a dog\
> Answer = Name of dog's breed\
> Dataset = Wikipedia's list of Extant Dog Species (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_dog_breeds)

time_100_photos.py:
> Question = A famous photograph\
> Answer = Photograph title, photographer name, year taken\
> Dataset = Time's 100 Most Influential Photos (http://100photos.time.com/)
<br />
<br />
